**NOTE:** Though Netflix has put Hystrix into maintenance mode, NHystrix will continue to evolve as a resiliency library for .Net.

NHystrix is inspired by [Netflix/Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix): "a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable."

The goal of this project is to provide the same functionality to C#/.Net applications.

## NuGet

The package currently targets NetStandard2.0, NetCoreApp3.0, Net452, and Net461.
